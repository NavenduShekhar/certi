      "['The Godfather', \"March\\xa014,\\xa01972Loew's State Theatre) March\\xa024,\\xa01972\", 'Marlon Brando Al Pacino James Caan Richard Castellano Robert Duvall Sterling Hayden John Marley Richard Conte Diane Keaton', 'In 1945 New York City, at his daughter Connie\\'s wedding to Carlo, Vito Corleone, the don of the Corleone crime family listens to requests. His youngest son, Michael, who was a Marine during World War II, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a popular singer and Vito\\'s godson, seeks Vito\\'s help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion.\\nShortly before Christmas, drug baron Sollozzo, backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. Brasi is garroted to death during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later, Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen, then has Vito gunned down in the street. With Corleone first-born Sonny in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo\\'s deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi\\'s bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca \"sleeps with the fishes\". Vito survives, and at the hospital, Michael thwarts another attempt on his father. Michael\\'s jaw is broken by NYPD Capt. McCluskey, Sollozzo\\'s unofficial bodyguard. Sonny retaliates with a hit on Tattaglia’s son. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey; feigning a desire to settle the dispute, Michael meets them in a Bronx restaurant, where after retrieving a handgun planted by Clemenza, a Corleone capo, he kills both men.\\nDespite a clampdown by the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare, and Vito fears for his sons\\' safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and Fredo is sheltered by Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks Carlo on the street for abusing Connie and threatens to kill him if it happens again. When it does, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and violently murdered by gangsters wielding submachine guns. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries Apollonia, but a car bomb intended for him takes her life.\\nDevastated by Sonny\\'s death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant don, Barzini, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny\\'s murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo too weak, Michael takes the family reins. He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Hagen is not a \"wartime consigliere\"; Vito agrees Hagen should \"have no part in what will happen\" in the coming battles with the rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene\\'s stake in the family\\'s casinos, he is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family.\\nIn 1955, Vito suffers a fatal heart attack. At the funeral, Tessio, a Corleone capo, asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signaling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie\\'s baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child\\'s godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the other New York City dons and Greene. Tessio\\'s treachery leads to his execution. Michael extracts Carlo\\'s confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny\\'s murder for Barzini; Clemenza garrotes Carlo to death. Connie accuses Michael of the murder, telling Kay that Michael ordered all the killings. Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it, but when the capos arrive, they address her husband as Don Corleone and she watches them pay reverence to Michael as the newly installed don as they close the door on her.']\n",

Don barely tolerates his vain, cunning, conniving, and shallow leading lady, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), though their studio, Monumental Pictures, links them romantically to increase their popularity. Lina is convinced that they are in love, despite Don\\'s protestations otherwise.\\nAt the premiere of his latest film, The Royal Rascal, Don tells the gathered crowd a sarcastic, hyperbolic version of his life story, including his motto: \"Dignity, always dignity.\" His words are humorously contradicted by flashbacks showing him alongside his best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O\\'Connor). (\"Fit as a Fiddle\") To escape from his fans after the premiere, Don jumps into a passing car driven by Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). She drops him off, but not before claiming to be a stage actress and sneering at his \"undignified\" accomplishments as a movie star.\\nLater, at an after party, the head of Don\\'s studio, R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell), shows a short demonstration of a talking picture, but his guests are unimpressed. To Don\\'s amusement, Kathy pops out of a mock cake right in front of him, revealing herself to be a chorus girl. (\"All I Do is Dream of You\") Furious at Don\\'s teasing, she throws a real cake at him, only to accidentally hit Lina in the face and flee. Don becomes smitten with Kathy and searches for her for weeks, with Cosmo trying to cheer him up. (\"Make \\'Em Laugh\") While filming a romantic scene, a jealous Lina reveals that her influence is behind Kathy\\'s loss of work and subsequent disappearance. On the studio lot, Cosmo finally finds Kathy quietly working in another Monumental Pictures production (\"Beautiful Girl\") and gets Don. Don sings her a love song, and she confesses to having been a fan of his all along. (\"You Were Meant for Me\")\\nAfter rival studio Warner Bros. has an enormous hit with its first talking picture, the 1927 film The Jazz Singer, R.F. decides he has no choice but to convert the next Lockwood and Lamont film, The Dueling Cavalier, into a talkie. The production is beset with difficulties, including Lina\\'s grating voice and strong New York accent. Exasperated diction coaches try to teach her and Don how to speak properly, but to no avail. (\"Moses\") The Dueling Cavalier\\'s preview screening is a disaster; the actors are barely audible thanks to the awkward placing of the microphones, Don repeats the line \"I love you\" to Lina over and over, to the audience\\'s derisive laughter, and in the middle of the film, the sound goes out of synchronization, with hilarious results as Lina shakes her head while the villain\\'s deep voice says, \"Yes! Yes! Yes!\" and the villain nods his head while Lina\\'s squeaky soprano says, \"No! No! No!\"\\nAfterwards, (\"Good Morning\") Don, Kathy, and Cosmo come up with the idea to turn The Dueling Cavalier into a musical called The Dancing Cavalier, complete with a modern musical number and backstory. The three are disheartened when they realize Lina\\'s terrible voice remains a problem; but Cosmo, inspired by a scene in The Dueling Cavalier where Lina\\'s voice was out of sync, suggests that they dub Lina\\'s voice with Kathy\\'s. (\"Singin\\' In the Rain\") After hearing Don and Cosmo pitch the idea, R.F. approves but tells them not to inform Lina that Kathy is doing the dubbing. (\"Broadway Melody\") When Lina barges in on a dubbing session and learns the truth, (\"Would You\") she is infuriated. She becomes even angrier when she discovers that R.F. intends to give Kathy a screen credit and a big publicity buildup afterward. Lina threatens to sue R.F. unless he makes sure no one ever hears of Kathy and that she keeps dubbing for the rest of her career. R.F. reluctantly agrees, as a clause in Lina\\'s contract states that the studio is responsible for positive media coverage of her.\\nThe premiere of The Dancing Cavalier is a tremendous success. When the audience clamors for Lina to sing live, Don, Cosmo, and R.F. tell her to lip sync into a microphone while Kathy, concealed behind the curtain, sings into a second one. While Lina is \"singing\", (\"Singin\\' in the Rain Reprise\") Don, Cosmo, and R.F. gleefully raise the curtain, revealing the fakery. Lina flees in humiliation, and a distressed Kathy tries to run away as well, but Don proudly announces to the audience that she\\'s \"the real star\" of the film. (\"You Are My Lucky Star\") Later, Kathy and Don kiss in front of a billboard for their new film, Singin\\' in the Rain.']\n",

      "['The Searchers', 'May\\xa016,\\xa01956Chicago Theatre)[1]', 'John Wayne Jeffrey Hunter Vera Miles Ward Bond Natalie Wood', 'In 1868, Ethan Edwards returns after an eight-year absence to the home of his brother Aaron in the wilderness of West Texas. Ethan fought in the Civil War on the side of the Confederacy, and in the three years since that war ended, he apparently fought in the Mexican revolutionary war, as well. He has a large quantity of gold coins of uncertain origin in his possession, and a medal from the Mexican campaign that he gives to his eight-year-old niece, Debbie. As a former Confederate soldier, he is asked to take an oath of allegiance to the Texas Rangers; he refuses. As Rev. Captain Samuel Clayton remarks, Ethan \"fits a lot of descriptions\" (in reference to whether he may be wanted for any crime).\\nShortly after Ethan\\'s arrival, cattle belonging to his neighbor Lars Jorgensen are stolen, and when Captain Clayton leads Ethan and a group of Rangers to recover them, they discover that the theft was a Comanche ploy to draw the men away from their families. When they return, they find the Edwards homestead in flames. Aaron, his wife Martha, and their son Ben are dead, and Debbie and her older sister Lucy have been abducted.\\nAfter a brief funeral, the men set out in pursuit. They come upon a burial ground of Comanches who were killed during the raid. Ethan mutilates one of the bodies. When they find the Comanche camp, Ethan recommends a frontal attack, but Clayton insists on a stealth approach to avoid killing the hostages. The camp is deserted, and further along the trail, the men ride into an ambush. Although they fend off the attack, the Rangers are left with too few men to fight the Indians effectively. They return home, leaving Ethan to continue his search for the girls with only Lucy\\'s fiancé, Brad Jorgensen and Debbie\\'s adopted brother, Martin Pawley. Ethan finds Lucy brutally murdered and presumably raped in a canyon near the Comanche camp. In a blind rage, Brad rides directly into the Indian camp and is killed.\\n\\nWhen winter arrives, Ethan and Martin lose the trail and return to the Jorgensen ranch. Martin is enthusiastically welcomed by the Jorgensens\\' daughter Laurie, and Ethan finds a letter waiting for him from a trader named Futterman, who claims to have information about Debbie. Ethan, who would rather travel alone, leaves without Martin the next morning, but Laurie provides Martin with a horse to catch up. At Futterman\\'s trading post, Ethan and Martin learn that Debbie has been taken by Scar, the chief of the Nawyecka band of Comanches. A year or more later, Laurie receives a letter from Martin describing the ongoing search. In reading the letter aloud, Laurie narrates the next few scenes, in which Ethan kills Futterman for trying to steal his money, Martin accidentally buys a Comanche wife, and the two men find a portion of Scar\\'s band killed by soldiers.\\n\\nThe search leads Ethan and Martin to a military fort, and then to New Mexico, where a Mexican man leads them to Scar. They find Debbie after five years, now an adolescent, living as one of Scar\\'s wives. She tells the men that she has become a Comanche, and wishes to remain with them. Ethan would rather see her dead than living as an Indian, and tries to shoot her, but Martin shields her with his body and a Comanche wounds Ethan with an arrow as they escape. Although Martin tends to Ethan\\'s wound, he is furious with him for attempting to kill Debbie, and wishes him dead. \"That\\'ll be the day,\" Ethan replies, as they return home.\\nMeanwhile, Charlie McCorry has been courting Laurie in Martin\\'s absence. Ethan and Martin arrive home just as Charlie and Laurie\\'s wedding is about to begin. After a fistfight between Martin and Charlie, a nervous \"Yankee\" soldier, Lt. Greenhill, arrives with news that Ethan\\'s half-crazy friend Mose Harper has located Scar. Clayton leads his men to the Comanche camp, this time for a direct attack, but Martin is allowed to sneak in ahead of the assault to find Debbie, who welcomes him. Martin kills Scar during the battle, and Ethan scalps him. Ethan then locates Debbie, and pursues her on horseback. Martin fears that he will shoot her as he has promised, but instead he sweeps her up onto his saddle. \"Let’s go home, Debbie,\" he says. She is brought to the Jorgensen ranch, and Martin reunites with Laurie. In an iconic closing scene, Ethan departs the homestead as he arrived—alone—clutching his arm, the cabin door slowly shutting on his receding image.']\n",
